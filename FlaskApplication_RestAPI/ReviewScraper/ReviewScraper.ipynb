The phone has dual sim option both are nano sim .\\n\\n12. This phone has One of the best finger print which is similar to Apple touch id .\\n\\n\\nCons :\\n\\n1. The phone has one cons .that is Hybrid sim slot .Which means you can not use sd card when you use second sim card slot .\\n\\nif you want to use sd card then you have to remove your second sim ...so you can use either second sim or sd card ...\\n\\nVerdict :\\n\\nOverall i am very much happy .day to day tasks performs well ...\\n\\ncomparing the price there may phones available in the market ASUS and one plus 2 etc ...\\n\\nHowever asus can not match with Galaxy A8 built quality and also receiving OS updates \\n\\nOne plus 2 wait time is more and that has cheap plastic quality only 13 mega pixel camera  .even one plus 2  has 4Gb RAM that is ddr3 not like galaxy A8 DDR4 Ram\"}\n",

Till date, I was using mobile phones below 20,000 Rs. This time however, I needed an allrounder phone having fast internet speed, dual sim slot, expandable memory, good camera and slim built and with one week of my experience I must say that Samsung Galaxy A8 has fulfilled most of the requirements. Usually smartphones having such a giant screen have average battery performance but samsung A8 battery is quite good. Well, I think I would mislead people if I don't mention the major flaws in this otherwise great phone :-\\n    1) Heats up fast when charging & sometimes while using internet for a bit long time.\\n    2) Use either second sim or memory card. No separate slot for memory card.\\n    3) 2GB Ram gets easily occupied upto 75% because of preinstalled apps.\\nI would recommend this phone for it's dual sim, great battery, slim built and good camera.\"}\n",

It maintains d Samsung quality and can be of grt use for users to like to click a lot\\n3) Built Quality is great... the metal body gives a premium look in hand.\\n4) Battery backup is great regarding its RAM nd FHD screen\\n5) Fingerprint Scanner is Handy\\n\\nCONS : over powers the pros in many departments \\n\\n1) Highly OVER PRICED. The price on flipkart varies from 26K to 36k.\\nAs far as the features r concerned there r much better phones in market on considerable low price so CHOOSE WISELY.\\n\\n2) 3GB RAM would have been great at this price range instead samsung gives us the same old 2GB stuff...so NOT AMONG THE FASTEST DEVICES at this price range...\\nEven Samsung's  very own A7-2016 is faster at the same price tag\\n\\n3) LACK of NOTIFICATION LED is just one of the most Pathetic Cons in this device.\\nAt this price range its a must stay feature on every device. Even devices within 10K come with Notification LED nowadays..so quite unfortunate \\n\\n4) Lack of a proper 2nd Sim card slot i.e the hybrid nature of this device might be problematic for some users but it dpnds on preferences\\n\\nVerdict : Overall a gud device if one opts for Reliability of Samsung but i feel its highly over priced and there r much better choices available.. Users can also wait few more months untill d arrival of A9 when A8 faces a price drop.\\n...\\nThank You\"}\n",

I am really amazed to see how soft can a gorilla glass be that it can get shattered without any pressure on it .. Before buying this phone i went through the reviews of Gorilla glass and i found that it nearly impossible to shatter it unless it really treated harshly .. but i unable to why my glass got shattered.

Everything is same.\\n\\nProblem with this phone:\\nNo Facebook Calander Sync.\\nMagnetic sensor is there but Compass app is missing.\\nTouch is pathetic, many times u have to touch twice to open or close things specially while disconnecting calls. \\nUnlike Grand 2 it does not have rotating screens, it stops at the last screen and then u have to swipe opposite. \\nCoverage is also weak on the places where other phones are in coverage but it is not.\\nWorst Inbuilt app for calendar and clock.\\nThe email app is most third class, it does not retrieve mails if you delete them from server (in case of corporate mails).\\nNo IR Blaster, NO NFC, or DLNA, other companies are giving at this price range.\\nSometimes it forgets your fingerprint totally. It happened with me twice. U have to use the backup password.\\nu can scan only 3 finger prints, whereas in Apple u can scan 10. the scanner is very poor.\\nIt updates almost every third day.\\n\\nConclusion: Do Not buy, I have also sold it immediately. Soon u will all listen about it so better u not go for it.'}\n",

Makes sense to use UPI for direct bank transfer rather than the plethora of wallets, doesn't it? \\n\\n__Can I transfer funds from PhonePe wallet? If yes, how much can be transferred?__\\n\\n Yes, you can transfer funds from PhonePe wallet to your bank account using the Bank Account Number and Branch IFSC Code.
